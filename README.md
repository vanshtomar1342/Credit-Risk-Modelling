This project aims to develop a machine learning model for assessing credit risk. The dataset used contains information on loan applicants and their financial history to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. To enhance model performance, I applied feature selection techniques such as the Chi-Square test and ANOVA test to identify the most relevant variables. After selecting the key features, I used Grid Search CV to fine-tune hyperparameters and determine the best-performing model, which was XGBoost.
